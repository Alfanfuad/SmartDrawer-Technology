# SmartDrawer System

## Introduction

The **SmartDrawer System** is designed to enhance the efficiency and security of tool management in various work lines. This innovative system ensures that tools are efficiently managed, tracked, and secured, providing significant time savings and reducing the risk of tool loss.

### Features and Operation

1. **Tool Storage and Accessibility**:
    - SmartDrawer units are strategically placed in each work line, utilizing specialized docking stations.
    - These docking stations can only be accessed by authorized personnel, ensuring secure tool storage.

2. **Tool Usage and Tracking**:
    - Once the docking station is opened, SmartDrawer tools can be accessed and used.
    - Every tool borrowing action is automatically recorded by the SmartDrawer system, ensuring accurate tracking of tool usage.

3. **Monitoring and Data Access**:
    - The tool store monitors SmartDrawer units through a web-based system, allowing for real-time tracking.
    - Technicians can also access borrowing data via the web, enhancing transparency and accountability.

4. **Security Features**:
    - Docking stations will not lock if any SmartDrawer tools are missing, preventing unauthorized removal.
    - At the end of each shift, tool store personnel inspect each line to ensure all tools are accounted for, as reflected in the web system.

### Benefits of SmartDrawer

- **Prevents Loss**: The automated tracking system eliminates the loss of tools.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tool status and borrowing activities can be monitored from anywhere via the web.
- **Reduces Borrowing Time**: Borrowing tools from the drawer is simplified (only 2 minutes), reducing queue times at the tool store and increasing efficiency for both technicians and tool store personnel.

### Workflow

- **Start to Work**: Tools are stored in designated areas, ready for use at the beginning of a shift.
- **SmartDrawer Used**: Tools are accessed and used during the shift, with all activities monitored and recorded.
- **End Shift**: At the end of the shift, tool store personnel ensure all tools are returned and accounted for, as per the web system.

### Additional Notes

- The SmartDrawer system ensures that tool drawers cannot be locked if tools are missing.
- This system significantly reduces the time spent on tool borrowing and returning, improving overall workflow efficiency.
